					People around the world are demanding clean air -- and cities are
					starting to respond, says electrification advocate Monica Araya. She
					takes us on a world tour of urban areas that are working to fully
					electrify their transportation systems over the next decade, shifting
					to emission-free motorcycles, cars, buses, ferries and beyond. See
					what a future without the internal combustion engine could look like
					-- and what it will take to get there.
